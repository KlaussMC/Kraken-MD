*Kraken MD* is a markdown renderer for the Windows operating system. Its purpose is to display formatted markdown.

To begin, open Kraken MD and go to `File > Open` or press CTRL+O and select a `.md` file. Your file will be displayed in the window.

You can also open a file immediately via the command line. Simply enter `python index.py <filepath>` where `<filepath>` is an absolute or relative path to the file.
